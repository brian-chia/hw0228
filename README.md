Hi guys,

The plots are under the Figures folder.
If you want to run this code by yourself, please be sure to install "cython" on your computer.
Also, download the 6 pickle files if you would want to reproduce the figures.
Otherwise, everything is laid out in this repo. The reference paper regarding FDM is also here.
